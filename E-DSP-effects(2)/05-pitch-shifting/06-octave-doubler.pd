2048 samples ago. We introduce a delay of 2048 samples (converted to

#X text 110 70 sigmund~ can analyze windows of audio (in this case
\, 2048 samples at a time) \, and determine the current pitch in MIDI
note numbers. But there's a latency associated with this: the pitch
it currently reports was actually the pitch 2048 samples ago. We have
to account for this latency below., f 42;

#X text 635 477 The technique here is to mix down two signals: the
original input \, and copy that is delayed by exactly one half the
period of the current pitch. The simplest example would be a straight
sine wave. If you mix a sine wave with a copy of itself delayed by
one half its period (i.e. \, 180 degrees out of phase) \, it disappears
because it cancels out completely. With real signals that have several
harmonics \, the cancellation only happens for the odd harmonics (the
fundamental \, the 3rd harmonic \, the 5th harmonic \, etc). For the
even harmonics \, the half-cycle delayed signal aligns for constructive
interference \, so those components of the signal are strengthened
rather than cancelled out. The result is a spectrum that is identical
to that of the signal if it were one octave higher.;

over and over again. The output is sent over a wireless send~ and received
at various places in the patch., f 34;
