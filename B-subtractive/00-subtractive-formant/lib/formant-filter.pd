#X text 151 77 We use [send~]/[receive~] in cases where there is one
source and many destinations. Here \, there is one source (the sawtooth
wave to be filtered) \, and many destinations (the formant filter abstraction
instances \, like this one).;
#X text 164 148 The 3 creation arguments to this abstraction are the
band-pass center frequency \, band-pass filter Q \, and a gain value
in linear amplitude.;
#X text 174 234 We use [throw~]/[catch~] in cases where there are many
sources \, but one destination. Here \, there are 5 instances of this
formant-filter.pd abstraction \, which are the signal sources. The
single destination is the [catch~] in the master patch \, which sends
the summed signal to the enveloping subpatch before output to the [dac~]
